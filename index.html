    <p> We will be a team of devils. Our colours will be red like fire and black to invoke fear in our opponents!” These were the words that Herbert Kilpin used as he founded AC Milan on 16 December 1899. Just a year and a half later, the Rossoneri became the champions of Italy for the first time after beating Genoa 3-0 at Ponte Carrega on 5 May 1901.</p>

    <h3>Rossoneri’s history</h3>

    <p><sup>The first celebration took place at AC Milan's first headquarters, the Fiaschetteria Toscana on Via Berchet in Milan, in 1899. Words, places and dates that gave rise to the Rossoneri’s glorious history. This is a Club that has contributed hugely to the world of football, so much so that AC Milan held the most international titles recognised by FIFA from December 2007 to February 2014.</sup>
      <br><br>
       The Rossoneri’s history is now the stuff of legend, as are the men who have helped to write it – be they presidents, coaches or footballers. There have been so many historic figures, from the Englishman Alfred Edwards, under whom the Club won its first league title, and Andrea Rizzoli, the first President of AC Milan and an Italian team to win the European Cup in 1963 at Wembley, through to <strong> Silvio Berlusconi</strong>, the President who had the most success in Italy,
